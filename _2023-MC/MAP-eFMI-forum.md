**Time:** Thursday, 12/Oct/2023, 9:30am--12:00am (noon).

We are happy to announce that there will be an open discussion panel providing an opportunity to get in contact with [MAP eFMI®](https://www.efmi-standard.org/) and publicly discuss ideas, feedback, requirements and new use cases; or simply clarify any questions you have about eFMI. The forum is an unique chance to get in contact with eFMI experienced tool developers and users and more deeply discuss any ideas you got from the [tutorial on Monday](eFMI-tutorial.md).

If you are interested to join, please write an e-mail to:
 - [`efmi-info@googlegroups.com`](https://groups.google.com/g/efmi-info) (public mailing list; no Google account required)
 - Christoff.Buerger@3ds.com (private e-mail address of MAP eFMI project leader, if you do not want your mail in public space)
